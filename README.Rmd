# Washington Climate Smart Estimator (WaCSE) 

The [Washington State Department of Agriculture](https://agr.wa.gov/departments/land-and-water/natural-resources) developed WaCSE for the Washington State Conservation Commission to use in the [Sustainable Farms and Fields](https://www.scc.wa.gov/sff) (SFF) program. Intended users are the Conservation Commission, conservation districts, growers, and anyone interested in identifying agricultural conservation practices to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This user-friendly, interactive web application facilitates comparing GHG emission reduction potentials from different conservation practices across Washingtonâ€™s diverse counties.

This app was built using the [Golem](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) framework.
