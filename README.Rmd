# Washington Climate Smart Estimator (WaCSE) 

The <a href= "https://agr.wa.gov/departments/land-and-water/natural-resources" target="_blank">Washington State Department of Agriculture</a> developed WaCSE for the Washington State Conservation Commission to use in the <a href="https://www.scc.wa.gov/sff" target="_blank">Sustainable Farms and Fields</a> (SFF) program. Intended users are the Conservation Commission, conservation districts, growers, and anyone interested in reducing agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This interactive tool estimates the reduction of GHG emissions from different conservation practices across Washingtonâ€™s diverse counties.

This app was built using the <a href= "https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem" target = "_blank">Golem</a> framework.
