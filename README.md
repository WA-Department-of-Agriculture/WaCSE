# Washington Climate Smart Estimator (WaCSE)

The [Washington State Department of
Agriculture](https://agr.wa.gov/departments/land-and-water/natural-resources)
developed WaCSE for the Washington State Conservation Commission to use
in the [Sustainable Farms and Fields](https://www.scc.wa.gov/sff) (SFF)
program. Intended users are the Conservation Commission, conservation
districts, growers, and anyone interested in reducing agricultural
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This interactive tool estimates the
reduction of GHG emissions from different conservation practices across
Washingtonâ€™s diverse counties.

This app was built using the
[Golem](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) framework.

## Install and run WaCSE

You can install and run the development version of WaCSE from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
