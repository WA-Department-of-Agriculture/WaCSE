# Washington Climate Smart Estimator (WaCSE)

The Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) developed WaCSE as
a Shiny application for the Washington State Conservation Commission
(SCC) to use in the [Sustainable Farms and
Fields](https://www.scc.wa.gov/sff) (SFF) program. Intended users are
SCC, conservation districts, and farmers interested in identifying
conservation practices to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The
interactive platforms facilitate comparing GHG emission reduction
potentials from different conservation practices across Washingtonâ€™s
diverse counties.

This app was built using the
[Golem](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) framework.
