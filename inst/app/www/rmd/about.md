# Washington Climate Smart Estimator (WaCSE)

### Who and what is WaCSE for?

The
<a href= "https://agr.wa.gov/departments/land-and-water/natural-resources" target="_blank">Washington
State Department of Agriculture</a> developed WaCSE for the Washington
State Conservation Commission to use in the
<a href="https://www.scc.wa.gov/sff" target="_blank">Sustainable Farms
and Fields</a> (SFF) program. Intended users are the Conservation
Commission, conservation districts, growers, and anyone interested in
identifying agricultural conservation practices to reduce greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions. This user-friendly, interactive web application
facilitates comparing GHG emission reduction potentials from different
conservation practices across Washington’s diverse counties.

### Where do the potential GHG emission reduction values come from?

Values were determined by the United States Department of Agriculture’s
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). NRCS reviewed field
studies and applied a sample-based metamodeling approach to calculate
potential GHG emission reduction coefficients. These values are derived
from county-rectified major land resource areas (Swan et al. 2020).

NRCS and Colorado State University developed two tools to estimate
impacts on GHG and soil carbon from conservation practices.

-   <a href="http://comet-farm.com" target="_blank">**COMET-Farm**</a>
    is a field-specific tool that requires more detailed information
    such as parcel, management history to define a system specific
    baseline, and intended conservation practices.

-   <a href="http://comet-planner.com" target="_blank">**COMET-Planner**</a>
    is a simplified tool that evaluates GHG emission reductions by
    county, conservation practice practice, and acreage based on a fixed
    baseline management scenario.

### How does WaCSE differ from COMET-Farm and COMET-Planner?

WaCSE uses the COMET-Planner dataset but presents the GHG emission
reductions data in a way that allows comparison between **multiple
counties** at one time. The data can be visualized in tables and bar
graphs. Users can also easily download the tables, bar graphs, and a PDF
report of all outputs from their estimate.

### What do negative values mean?

Negative values indicate a loss of carbon or increased emissions of GHG
(Swan et al. 2020).

### Where can I find more information about the NRCS conservation practices?

Technical guides for NRCS conservation practices standards (CPS) are
found
<a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/technical/cp/" target="_blank">here</a>).
