All NRCS conservation classes, practices, and implementations are described in the <a href='https://storage.googleapis.com/comet_public_directory/planner50states/pdfs/COMET-PlannerReport.pdf' target = "_blank">COMET-Planner Report</a>. 

**The NRCS has not evaluated all practices for every county.** Most practices in the Woody Plantings conservation class are limited to *either* Eastern or Western WA. Unavailable practices will not appear in the drop down menus.
