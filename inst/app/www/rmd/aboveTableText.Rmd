All NRCS conservation classes, practices, and implementations are described in the <a href='https://storage.googleapis.com/comet_public_directory/planner50states/pdfs/COMET-PlannerReport.pdf' target = "_blank">COMET-Planner Final Report</a>. 

**The NRCS has not evaluated all practices for every county.** Most practices in the Woody Plantings conservation class are limited to either Eastern or Western WA only. If an unavailable practice is selected, either "No data available in table" will appear or that practice will not be added to the table.
