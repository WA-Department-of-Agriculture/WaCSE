**Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq)** is a unit used to compare various greenhouse gases based on their relative global warming potential.

**Total greenhouse gases (GHG)** are the sum of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in units of CO2eq. Estimates include those associated with soils and woody biomass, but do not include off-site emissions like those from transportation.

**Emission reduction coefficients (ERC)** were calculated by <a href="https://comet-farm.com/" target="_blank"> COMET-Farm</a>, which uses USDA greenhouse gas inventory methods. More information on quantification methods can be found in the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/comet_public_directory/planner50states/pdfs/COMET-PlannerReport.pdf" target="_blank"> COMET-Planner Report</a>
