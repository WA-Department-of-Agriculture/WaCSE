**Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA)** are defined by the NRCS as regions with similar physiography, climate, soils, biological resources, and land use (USDA-NRCS 2006). The GHG emission reduction estimates were calculated at the spatial scale of these multi-county MLRAs (Swan et al. 2022).

**Use this map to identify which county is in which MLRA. Counties within the same MLRA will have the same estimate, unless the county falls within multiple MLRAs.**

The map may take a few moments to load.
