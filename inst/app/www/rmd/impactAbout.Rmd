### Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator

**Use this calculator to convert your estimated greenhouse gas emission reductions into terms you are more likely familiar with.** Assumptions and equations used to calculate these values are provided in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) <a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references" target ="_blank">Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator</a>. Results may differ slightly from those returned by EPA's calculator due to rounding.
