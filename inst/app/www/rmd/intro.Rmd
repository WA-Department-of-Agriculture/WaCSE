**What you can do with WaCSE:**

- **Explore the data:** Compare the greenhouse gas emission reduction estimates between counties and practices.

- **Calculate your estimate:** Input your county, practice, and number of acres to implement the practice on to build a downloadable report of your estimated greenhouse gas mitigation potential.

- **Understand your impact:** Convert your reduced emissions to the equivalent amount of CO2 emissions from home energy use, consuming gasoline, and charging smartphones.
