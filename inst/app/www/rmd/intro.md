    estimates between counties and practices.

-   **Calculate your estimate:** Input your county, practice, and
    acreage to build a downloadable report of your estimated greenhouse
    gas mitigation potential.

-   **Understand your impact:** Convert your reduced emissions to the
    equivalent from home energy use, consuming gasoline, charging
    smartphones, and more!
