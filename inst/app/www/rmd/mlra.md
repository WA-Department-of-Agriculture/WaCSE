**Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA)** are geographically associated land
resource units, defined by the US Department of Agriculture, that have
similarities in physiography, climate, soils, biological resources, and
land use (USDA-NRCS 2006). The GHG emission reduction estimates were
calculated at the spatial scale of these multi-county MLRAs (Swan et
al.Â 2020).

**Use this map to identify counties in different MLRAs to compare
practices between. Counties within the same MLRA will generally have the
same estimate, unless the county falls within multiple MLRAs.**
